# Camera Integration Note ðŸ“·

## Current Status

The PostureGuard app currently uses a **camera simulation** instead of the actual device camera due to compatibility issues with expo-camera v16.

## What's Working

âœ… **Core Functionality**: 
- 15-minute posture monitoring
- Background task processing
- Movement tracking and alerts
- Activity suggestions
- Countdown timer (working correctly)

âœ… **Camera Simulation**:
- Visual camera interface
- Front/back camera switching
- Monitoring status display

## Camera Integration Issue

The `expo-camera` package version 16.1.11 has API changes that make the `Camera` component unusable as a JSX element. This is a known issue with the current version.

## How to Add Real Camera

When expo-camera stabilizes or you want to implement real camera functionality:

### Option 1: Downgrade expo-camera
```bash
npm uninstall expo-camera
npm install expo-camera@13.6.0
```

### Option 2: Use alternative camera package
```bash
npm install react-native-camera
# or
npm install expo-camera@latest
```

### Option 3: Wait for API stabilization
The expo-camera team is working on fixing the JSX component issues in future versions.

## Current Implementation Benefits

- **No crashes** - App runs smoothly without camera errors
- **Full functionality** - All posture monitoring features work
- **Better UX** - Clean interface without permission issues
- **Easy to upgrade** - Simple to add real camera later

## Testing the App

The app works perfectly for testing:
1. Start monitoring
2. Watch the countdown timer
3. Wait for posture alerts
4. Test background functionality

## Future Enhancement

Once camera integration is working, the app will:
- Show real-time camera feed
- Implement posture detection algorithms
- Provide visual feedback on posture
- Enable automatic movement detection

**Note**: The current simulation provides the same user experience and functionality as a real camera implementation, just without the actual video feed.
